Hi! I'm Anishka! I was born in Ohio and grew up in Dallas, Texas. I got my undergrad in Mathematics from the University of Oklahoma. I am currently doing my Masters in Data Science at Southern Methodist University. Some things I enjoy doing are cooking new foods, playing guitar, and hanging out with my friends.

Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
